## Prompt

now you can implement the module 2 and chapter in the frontend_book folder, there is already a module 1 content existing there.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) in the frontend_book folder. Created three comprehensive chapters covering digital twins, Gazebo physics simulation, and Unity high-fidelity interaction. Added proper navigation structure, cross-references to Module 1 content, and validated the implementation by running the development server. All tasks from the task list have been completed successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete Module 2 with 3 detailed chapters and proper navigation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this documentation task
- 📁 Files: Created 4 new documentation files and updated sidebar/navigation
- 🔁 Next prompts: Module 2 is ready for review and use
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed all requirements and integrates well with existing Module 1

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with next module or feature
