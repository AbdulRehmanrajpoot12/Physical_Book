## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md file for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The tasks are organized in phases following the user stories (P1-P3) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. The implementation plan includes 48 tasks covering Setup, Foundational, and three user stories with all necessary implementation steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task list for AI robot brain module
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this documentation task
- 📁 Files: Generated tasks.md with 48+ tasks organized by user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation of individual tasks from the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing tasks from the generated list
