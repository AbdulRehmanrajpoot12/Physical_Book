# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics series. This module focuses on digital twin simulation using Gazebo and Unity, building upon the ROS 2 fundamentals from Module 1.

## About This Module

In this module, you'll learn about digital twin technology and how simulation environments enable safe, cost-effective development of humanoid robots. We'll explore both physics-based simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity visual simulation with Unity.

## Learning Path

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:

### [1. Digital Twins for Physical AI](./digital-twins-physical-ai)
- Understanding digital twin concepts
- The role of simulation in embodied intelligence
- Why humanoid robots require simulated environments

### [2. Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./gazebo-physics-simulation)
- Gazebo physics simulation capabilities
- Gravity, collision, and environmental physics
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)

### [3. High-Fidelity Simulation with Unity](./unity-high-fidelity-interaction)
- Unity's visual realism capabilities
- Human-robot interaction in simulation
- Training, testing, and validation approaches

## Target Audience

This module is designed for students who have completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals). Familiarity with robotics concepts and basic understanding of physics will be helpful.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, forces)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Digital Twins for Physical AI](./digital-twins-physical-ai) chapter to understand the fundamentals, then progress through each chapter to build a complete understanding of simulation technologies for humanoid robotics applications.
