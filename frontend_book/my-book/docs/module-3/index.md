# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for AI-powered robotics development that includes simulation, perception, and navigation capabilities specifically designed for advanced robotics applications.

## Module Overview

This module covers three critical aspects of AI-powered robotics:

1. **[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./nvidia-isaac-sim)** - Explore photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation techniques that enable training of robust perception models for humanoid robots. Learn how Isaac Sim's combination of accurate physics simulation and realistic rendering accelerates robotics development.

2. **[Isaac ROS & VSLAM](./isaac-ros-vslam)** - Discover how Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated perception capabilities and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) for humanoid robots. Understand how GPU acceleration enables real-time processing of complex perception tasks while maintaining ROS compatibility.

3. **[Navigation2 for Humanoid Navigation](./nav2-humanoid-navigation)** - Master Navigation2 concepts specifically adapted for bipedal humanoids, including path planning approaches that account for balance requirements and anthropomorphic navigation needs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Leverage NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception systems using Isaac ROS
- Apply Visual SLAM techniques for localization and mapping in humanoid robots
- Design navigation systems for bipedal robots using Navigation2
- Integrate perception and navigation systems for complete AI-robot brain functionality

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals from [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](../module-1/ros2-basics)
- Knowledge of simulation concepts from [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](../module-2/digital-twins-physical-ai)
- Basic understanding of perception and navigation concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with the [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./nvidia-isaac-sim) chapter to understand the simulation capabilities that form the foundation for training perception models in this module.
