# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines that integrate LLMs with robotics for perception, planning, and action. The module builds upon the ROS 2 fundamentals, simulation concepts, and NVIDIA Isaac technologies from previous modules to create complete autonomous humanoid systems.

## Module Overview

This module covers three critical aspects of autonomous humanoid systems:

1. **[Voice-to-Action](./voice-to-action)** - Explore speech recognition using OpenAI Whisper and converting voice commands to robot intents. Learn how to create natural voice interfaces for humanoid robots.

2. **[Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./llm-planning)** - Discover how to translate natural language into action sequences and map plans to ROS 2 actions. Understand how LLMs can enhance robotic planning capabilities.

3. **[Capstone – The Autonomous Humanoid](./autonomous-humanoid)** - Master end-to-end system integration with perception, navigation, manipulation pipelines. Build complete AI-powered humanoid robots that integrate all VLA components.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Process voice commands using OpenAI Whisper and convert them to robot intents
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning and translating natural language to action sequences
- Map high-level plans to specific ROS 2 actions for robot execution
- Integrate perception, navigation, and manipulation in complete autonomous systems
- Implement Vision-Language-Action pipelines for natural human-robot interaction
- Design end-to-end autonomous humanoid systems with safety and reliability

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals from [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](../module-1/ros2-basics)
- Knowledge of simulation concepts from [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](../module-2/digital-twins-physical-ai)
- Experience with NVIDIA Isaac technologies from [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](../module-3/nvidia-isaac-sim)
- Basic understanding of LLMs and their applications in robotics

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Voice-to-Action](./voice-to-action) chapter to understand the foundational voice processing capabilities that enable natural human-robot interaction in this module.
